## Internal Database (PlayerPrefs)
-	PlayerPrefs is the best class to use to keep the data in the games.
-	Unity stores up to 1MB of PlayerPrefs data using the browserâ€™s IndexedDB API.
-	IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high performance searches of this data.

## External Database (Firebase)
-	The simplest way is using rest api to communicate between webgl games with firebase
-	Reasons? Whenever users refresh the webgl game page, the data will lose its data. So the game needs to have its own external database.
-	We recommend you use Firebase as the database will save in real-time.
-	We use REST because Firebase SDK is not available for Standalone Unity Builds (Windows, MacOS, Linux).
-	Developers are recommended to look forward in the documentation on Firebase Database in Unity with REST API.
